# PRODIGY_CS-02
I made a simple image encryption tool developed using Python's PIL library! This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating pixel values, swapping red and blue channels for each pixel.
# Note: Before using this code you should install the "PILLOW" library in your Python environment.
